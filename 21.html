    <h1>chicken</h1>
    <p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of domesticated
        fowl. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals</p>
    <h2> Terminology </h2>
    <p>Chicken once referred to young domestic fowl in general. The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or
        just fowl.</p>
    <h3>Behavior</h3>
    <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
    <p>Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from neighbouring
        nests into their own</p>
    <h4>Broodiness</h4>
    <p> Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate all the
        eggs.</p>
