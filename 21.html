        <p> The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus), a subspecies of the red junglefowl, is a type of
            domesticated
            fowl. Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals</p>
        <h2> Terminology </h2>
        <p>Chicken once referred to young domestic fowl in general. The species as a whole was then called domestic
            fowl, or
            just fowl.</p>
        <h3>Behavior</h3>
        <h4>Social behaviour</h4>
        <p>Hens will often try to lay in nests that already contain eggs and have been known to move eggs from
            neighbouring
            nests into their own</p>
        <h4>Broodiness</h4>
        <p> Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is complete, and they will then incubate
            all the
            eggs.</p>
